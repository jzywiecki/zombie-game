#Zombie Game

##Overview

This is a simple shooting game where players shoot zombies with the mouse (left click). Zombies randomly appear from the right side of the screen and move towards the left at varying speeds. The objective is to shoot as many zombies as possible and earn points while avoiding missing shots. The game ends when three zombies reach the left side of the screen.

##Personalization

At the beginning of the game, players are prompted to enter a nickname, which is displayed over the game board.

##Highscores

Players can view their scores on a highscores list, which includes the player's position, nickname, score, and date of entry. The list is sorted based on the scores.

I also used JSON BLOB API to save highscores in web storage.
